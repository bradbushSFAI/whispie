# Whispie - Bugs & Issues

*Last updated: 2026-02-06*

## UI/Visual Issues

### Sign-in Page
- [ ] **"Practice tough questions…" text too light** — Text is getting lost, needs more contrast

### Onboarding
- [ ] **"Asking manager for feedback" button not clickable** — Button appears but doesn't respond to taps

### Scenario Page
- [ ] **Category pill text too dark** — "Asking Your Manager for Feedback" on purple pill needs lighter/white text for readability
- [ ] **Disclaimer text too dim** — "Whispie AI can make mistakes. This is practice, not real advice." needs to be brighter
- [ ] **No intro to scenario** — Unclear how to start the conversation, needs onboarding or prompt

## Content/Assets Needed

### Persona Images
- [ ] **Generate persona profile pictures** — Use nano-banana-pro (Gemini) to create illustrations for each persona
  - Personas: (list from seed data)
  - Style: TBD (illustration? realistic? avatar?)
